# Linux Learner 0.1.0

Currently in its pre-alpha stage, Linux Learner is a software package that creates an environment with folders and files on your Linux machine to practice the commands covered in the CompTIA Linux+ V8 XK0-006 exam.

### Note:

This version of Linux Learner is missing a heavy amount of features. Linux Learner Alpha (0.2.0) will bring a near-permanent workflow as the basis for all future versions.

The current version is not intended to be installed or downloaded, as this repository currently only serves to showcase the development process.


## Instalation

Stay tuned for updates on how to install this application. I am still working out how I plan to deploy this application to be installed by other computers and distributions.

### Prerequisites

_This project was created on a Debian-based system, and I am still experimenting with what distributions it will be available on, as well as what prerequisites and permissions are needed._

For now, here is a placeholder:

```bash
Install something
```

## Usage

Just like with the prerequisites, this is still being refined pre-deployment.
Stay tuned!


```bash
Example
```

## Deploy

Stay tuned!
