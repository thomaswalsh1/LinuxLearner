# Linux Learner

Linux Learner is a software package that creates an environment with folders and files on your Linux machine to practice the commands covered in the CompTIA Linux+ V8 XK0-006 exam.

## Instalation

Stay tuned for updates on how to install this application. I am still working out how I plan to deploy this application to be installed by other computers and distributions.

### Prerequisites

_This project was created on a Debian-based system, and I am still experimenting with what distributions it will be available on, as well as what prerequisites and permissions are needed._

For now, here is a placeholder:

```bash
Install something

## Usage

Just like with the prerequisites, this is still being refined pre-deployment.
Stay tuned!
